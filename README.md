## Installation

```sh
npm install auskema -g
```

## Sources

For now auskema can only use the [lukasj.org]( http://lukasj.org/auskema/) json api as source (which is awesome check it out). But the reader can easily be extended to use other sources, see ./sources/template.js and ./config.json for more information on that.
